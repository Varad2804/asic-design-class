# Sum Calculation in C of numbers from 1 to N.

This project demonstrates how to compile and run a simple C program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using both GCC and the RISC-V compiler. Additionally, it covers basic debugging using Spike on a RISC-V architecture.

## Compiling the C Code with GCC

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Home Directory**
   ```bash
   cd
2. Create a .c file that calculates sum of numbers from 1 to N.
3. Now run this programme using the gcc compiler
   
 ```bash
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out
```

## Compile using RISCV
